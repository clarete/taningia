Taningia README file
====================

Intro
~~~~~

Taningia aims to be a toolkit for writting programs that focus in a
certain type of comunication: The `near realtime' one. This library
has the XMPP protocol as its base for things we call `comunication'
and the Atom standard (XML) for describing content.

How it works
~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the strongest arguments that made me start to write it is that
software should comunicate with other software and with
people. Another idea is thate people and software should have theier
presence in a network.

Instalation
~~~~~~~~~~~

We are using autotools as our building system, so to compile and
install taningia, you only need to run::

 $ ./configure && make && sudo make install

If you need more details, please read the INSTALL file.

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * libiksemel (1.2, 1.2+ seems to be broken)

Language support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All code is written in C. There are two main reasons for this::

 * It is fast and portable
 * I like C

I've also started to work in a python binding for taningia. It is far
to be considered minimally good but it is already possible to taste
some nice things of our lib through python =D

Feel free to send me a new port to any language you like!
