0.2.2

 * Improvements on the ta_list_remove() method. Now, instead of freeing
   a node, it returns the node and let's the user do whatever he/she
   wants. (This breaks the API and the ABI)

 * Adding a way to resolve srv domains (not yet integrated with builtin
   xmpp client)

 * Improving logging system to send the time and logger name to the
   custom handler callback

0.2.1

 * Fixing indirect linking problem when compiling some example programs

 * Removing all references for python (and binding) stuff. It was moved
   to a separated project.

 * Small fix in ta_xmpp_client_send_and_filter() to return 1. This was
   not a complete fix since the error handling in taningia is a complete
   mess up :(

 * Adding the _sort() method to our ta_list structure

0.2

 * Some fixes and changes in the atom lib.

 * Heavy change in the pubsub API. Now we don't have classes but only
   functions that receives a bunch of params.

 * Documentation improvements and some standard changes.

 * Defining a reference count infrastructure based in the ta_object_t
   `class'. All other classes in taningia (except ta_list_t) are using
   it now.

 * Some memory leak fixes.

 * Adding an API to send stanzas and register callbacks to be called
   when the server answers -- ta_xmpp_client_send_and_filter().

 * Coding style changes.

 * Renaming example programs, old names had no standard at all.

 * Using silent rules in build scripts.

 * Fixes in build system adding m4 directory and checks for some GNU
   extensions like strndup().
